         conjur[ing] darkness".His songs have a brooding atmosphere, with the subject matter often revolving around themes of 
         introspection and angst. This results in the pervasive dark tone that populates both the lyrics and instrumentation, 
         which itself incorporates elements of drill, trap, and cloud rap, as well as ambient elements.</h3>
<!--information on Skeler-->
<h2>A little bit about Skeler</h2>
    <h3>Skeler started producing music after high school, mostly Dubstep, Trap and more heavier styles of music. The heavy bass 
        music scene was, and still is big in Perth/Australia where he grew up, however there was always a part of him that really enjoyed 
        that chill music you can listen to at home or by yourself. Skeler started to find more and more artists within this realm, 
        two of which were Kareful and Da Vosk Docta. Their music inspired him to start releasing music under the name 'Skeler'.
        Skeler`s first track entitled '1992' was an ode to Da Vosk Docta's track '1991'</h3>
<!--Skeler`s Music Style-->
<h2>Skeler Music Style</h2>
    <h3>Skeler produces a genre of music known as "Wave" music. Wave attempts to convey emotions such as melancholy, and 
        qualities such as dreaminess, femininity, and otherworldliness. In this context it is comparable with genres such 
        as witch house and emo rap. Wave emphasizes melodic and harmonic aspects using tools like arpeggiation and 
        atmospheric pads. It also draws from styles such as trap and grime for interludes and drum beats. The genre 
        utilities science fiction themes style akin to grime, Wave has experimentalism relative 
        to the Los Angeles beat scene, and incorporates elements from many other genres such as hip-hop, dubstep, UK 
        garage, drill, vaporwave, cloud rap, video game music and sound design, ambient, house, techno, and jungle.</h3>
